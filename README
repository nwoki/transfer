# Transfer
==========

A file transfer application used for transferring stuff between computers on the same LAN.

After being tired of having a slow network, and skype wasn't up to the task, I decided to start this mini project
in order to have a fast way of transferring data between pcs without the need of an account/email. Just some
basic setup is needed in order to identify the user on the LAN.
